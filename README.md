    1. As a client, to write (send): `tftp-now-{OS}-{ARCH} write -remote remote/path/to/write.bin -local write.bin`


# Download & Run

Download the latest executable from [the release page](https://github.com/puhitaku/tftp-now/releases/latest). If there's no binary that runs on your system, please raise an issue.

```

Example (serve): start serving on 0.0.0.0:69

  $ tftp-now write -host 192.168.1.1 -remote dir/foo -local bar


Tips:
  - If tftp-now executable itself or a link to tftp-now is named "tftp-now-serve",
    tftp-now will start a TFTP server without any explicit subcommand. Please specify
    a subcommand if you want to specify options.
  - The block size for the server will be clamped to the smaller of the block size
    a client requests and the MTU (minus overhead) of the interface.

# Why

I enjoy installing OpenWrt onto routers, but one of the main challenges is transferring it to the bootloader via TFTP. To do this, a temporary TFTP server or client is necessary, but I have always struggled with setting up a TFTP server.

While macOS has an out-of-the-box TFTP server, it requires running launchctl to invoke the hidden server. The process is tricky, and I always Google for guidance.

Linux distros, on the other hand, usually don't have a built-in TFTP server. Installing tftpd via apt is an option, but it's configured for inetd by default and requires some additional configuration. Only the manpage and Google can provide guidance on how to do it properly.

As for Windows, it doesn't come with a TFTP server by default, except for the server variants. Community-based software is the first choice for Windows, and again, Google is the go-to source for finding the right software to download.

It's frustrating that setting up a TFTP server is always such a hassle. This is why I created tftp-now.
